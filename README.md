### This is a markdown file explaining the project.
Here I want to store something about the **release!**
<br>
Ok the project will be rebuild from what is it on it now!
<br>
It only serves me as a personal start page and will be often edited in the future!
<br>
It will take some time.
<br>
#### But what I have in mind:
- more black rectangles
- added weather
- added random background on every opening
- more customized pages

So far my work is based on https://github.com/m-hrstv/startpage/tree/master
<br>
And this one is personalised for my needs!

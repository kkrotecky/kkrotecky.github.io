## This is a markdown file explaining the project.
Here I want to store something about the **release!**
<br>
Ok the project will be rebuild from what is it on it now!
<br>
It only serves me as a personal start page and will be often edited in the future!
<br>
It will take some time. But I hope to learn something in the process!
<br>
#### But what I have in mind:
- more black rectangles
- add weather
- add random background on every opening
- more customized pages

So far my work is based on **M-hrstv** project: https://github.com/m-hrstv/startpage/tree/master
<br>
And this one is personalised for my needs!
<br>
#### Changes from the original project so far:
- changed the clock to 24h one
- added autofocus on the 'Google Search'
- changed DuckDuckGo to Google
